# WGCNA Analysis Report: Gene Co-expression in Brachypodium

## 1. Methodology
To construct the gene co-expression network, we used the **WGCNA** package in R. The analysis was performed on RNAseq data from watered (W) samples of *Brachypodium distachyon*. 
* **Preprocessing:** Data was cleaned and filtered for high-quality expression.
* **Network Construction:** A weighted adjacency matrix was built using a soft-thresholding power.
* **Module Definition:** Clusters were identified using the Dynamic Tree Cut algorithm based on Topological Overlap (TOM).
* **Merging:** Similar modules were merged based on a correlation threshold of 0.75 (cut height 0.25).

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Expression Data** | `TPM_counts_Drought_W_dataset.csv` | Cleaned Matrix (9,940 genes) |
| **Outlier Analysis** | Transposed Matrix | `sampleClustering.pdf` |
| **Scaling** | Filtered Data | Scale-free Topology Fit Plots |
| **Module Analysis** | TOM Matrix | `net_W.RData` / Dendrograms |

## 3. Exercise Solutions (Results)

**3.1) Samples & Isoforms:**
The dataset `TPM_counts_Drought_W_dataset.csv` included **26 samples** and **9,940 genes** (isoforms) after initial filtering steps.

**3.2) Outliers:**
**0 samples** were discarded. After performing the outlier analysis, all samples clustered below the defined height threshold of $2.5 \times 10^5$.

**3.3) Power Value:**
A soft-thresholding power value of **6** was set as appropriate, as it was the lowest power reaching a Scale-Free Topology Fit ($R^2$) above 0.80 (specifically 0.879).

**3.4) Module Merging:**
Initially, **35+ modules** were established. After the merging process (using a cut height of 0.25), the modules were refined into a final set of consolidated color-coded groups.

**3.5) Cyan Module Hub:**
According to the module membership data, the hub isoform for the **cyan** module is **Bradi1g00700.3**.

**3.6) Trait Correlation:**
According to the module-trait association heat map, the **Violet module** has the highest positive correlation (**0.66**, $p=3 \times 10^{-4}$) with the **"blwgrd"** (below ground biomass) trait.

## 4. Problems Encountered
* **Dependency Issues:** Installation of the `GO.db` package failed via source; resolved by installing the **binary version** through BiocManager.
* **Path Access:** Windows path encoding issues were solved by moving the project to a root directory (`D:/Proje`).
* **Trait Data Sync:** Encountered a "file not found" error for `TRAITS_W.csv`, which was resolved by placing the file in the active working directory and re-running the `read.csv` command.

## 5. Proposed Experiment
**Title:** Identifying Drought-Resilience Hub Genes in Turkish Barley Landraces.
**Application:** This WGCNA pipeline can be applied to compare drought-tolerant vs. susceptible barley varieties. By identifying modules highly correlated with "Relative Water Content (RWC)", we could pinpoint hub genes that serve as biomarkers for breeding programs or targets for CRISPR-mediated yield improvement.
